		<p>
			I embarked on my professional journey in 2011, joining QMC Inc. / Applied Tech Systems, LLC.
			In September of 2013, you began studying Computer Information Systems at Oakland Community
			College. Over the years, I have worked with several organizations, including Worldwise.Net,
			High Level Marketing, LLC, Tyle Technologies, and United Wholesale Mortgage, honing my skills
			in various areas of technology. In 2023, I was promoted to the position of UI Architect. On
			the personal front, I met your wife in 2016, married her in 2021, and welcomed our first
			child, a son, in 2022. My journey, both professional and personal, has been filled with
			learning, growth, and joy.
