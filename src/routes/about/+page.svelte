	<p>
		Hello! I'm <strong>Casimer Guzdziol IV</strong>, a highly skilled Frontend Software Developer
		with expertise since 2015, predominantly in JavaScript and its ecosystem. I have profound
		knowledge in using modern build tools for monorepos and (p)npm, coupled with extensive
		experience in leading frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've had the privilege of working as a UI Architect at United Wholesale Mortgage, where I worked
		on several large-scale projects, including Brand360 and Bolt. I've also had the opportunity to
		mentor less experienced developers and provide guidance across multiple teams for products &
		standards.
	</p>

	<p>
		In addition to my frontend skills, I possess a strong background in PHP and Golang, enhancing my
		ability to deliver comprehensive and diverse software solutions. I'm passionate about advanced
		frontend JavaScript techniques and practices and am always eager to learn more and take on new
		challenges.
	</p>

	<p>
		Outside of work, I'm an avid sports enthusiast with a love for playing flag football, rock
		climbing, pickleball, baseball, and softball. When I was a younger man I wrestled through high
		school and for a year in college. I also enjoy a variety of music ranging from the 50s through
		today. I also share a reverance for movies and TV shows, that are also probably considered <em
			>too old</em
		> for my age group.
	</p>

	<p>
		In 2021, I embarked on a beautiful journey of marriage and celebrated the arrival of our first
		son in 2022. These personal milestones have enriched my life, giving me a deeper sense of
		purpose and joy.
	</p>

	<p>
		When I'm not coding or spending time with my family, I enjoy making strangers laugh and
		unmasking bad-guys after solving a crime with friends. Feel free to reach out to me at <a
