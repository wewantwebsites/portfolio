    title: Graduate from Holly Hgh School
    description: |
      I graduated from Holly High School in 2011 with a 2.8 GPA. 
      I did not take my academics seriously my freshman year but managed to pass every class, 
      albeit with a below 2.0 GPA. I was able to bring my GPA up over a 3.0 by the time I was a senior while taking
      Pre-Calculus, Phsysics, and Chemistry. I took AP Calculus and AP Chemistry but was more focused on my athletics resulting in my 
      grades slacking a bit. I was a 3 sport athlete in high school, playing football, wrestling, and baseball.
